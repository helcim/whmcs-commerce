** NOTICE **
While this module uses tokenization for card storage due to the way WHMCS is currently designed there are 
instances where local storage will be used. WHMCS will only call the storeremote function after a client
has at least one invoice set to the Helcim Gateway.

This is currently a feature request with WHMCS, more information can be found at:
